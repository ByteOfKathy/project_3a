# Katherine's branch (tree implementation and testing)

**Commands may differ for windows, these commands were ran on a unix based system**

## running the test python file

1. create a new venv using `python3 -m venv ./venv/` -- this creates a virtual environment in the folder venv
2. activate the virtual environment using the command `source ./venv/bin/activate`
3. install all required packages using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. run test.py using the command `python3 test.py`
5. when finished, run the command `deactivate` to stop using the virtual environment
